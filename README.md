# Echo Music Application

This project was made with React, Spotify API, and react-spotify-web-playback.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This will display the spotify logo and login button.
When clicked, the button will redirect to a spotify login page to gain access, then redirect to app after.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
